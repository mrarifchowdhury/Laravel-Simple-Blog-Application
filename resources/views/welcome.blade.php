        <p>'You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,' added the Gryphon; and then they
            both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said to
            the Mock Turtle, 'Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all day about it!' and he went on in these words:
            'Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it—'
            'I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.
            'You did,' said the Mock Turtle.</p>

            'Very good. Let me board you a moment—I come in peace.' With that he leaped from the canoe, swam to the
            boat; and climbing the gunwale, stood face to face with the captain.
            'Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now, repeat after me. As soon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear
            to beach this boat on yonder island, and remain there six days. If I do not, may lightning strike me!'A

            comrades.</p>
